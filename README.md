<h1>
    Sorting Visualizer
</h1>
<p>
    This program is a sorting visualizer that helps you to understand sorting algorithms by visualizing the process of sorting. It generates an array of random values, then visualizes the sorting process step by step.
</p>
<p>
    The program has two files: main.py and helper_file.py.
</p>
<p>
    The helper_file.py file includes window size, colors, bars amount, speed modes, functions for converting color types, and a class for storing value and color for each bar.
</p>
<p>
    The main.py file is the main program. It uses tkinter to create the GUI interface and customtkinter for creating customized widgets. The program creates a canvas for the visualizer and buttons for generating and sorting the array. It also includes an option menu for selecting the sorting algorithm and segmented button for selecting the amount of bars.
